A gummy o-ring mounted, Bakeneko-style 60% case with inspiration from Class80

Hi everyone!

This is a keyboard I made with inspiration from the Bakeneko and Class80. 

I've made it out of PLA and it works great.

Uses this daughterboard instead of C3 as it's difficult to get in the UK.

First manufacture still in progress.
