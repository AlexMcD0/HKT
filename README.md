A gummy o-ring mounted, Bakeneko-style 60% case with inspiration from Class80 and Snake

Hi everyone!

This is a keyboard I made with inspiration from the Bakeneko, Snake, and Class80. 

I'm making it out of PLA and it's works great so far. (First manufacture still in progress.)

Uses this daughterboard instead of C3 as it's difficult to get in the UK.
